    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "With the rise of online gaming communities, understanding player engagement has become an essential part of managing servers and designing outreach strategies. Knowing which kinds of players are more likely to stay involved can help developers plan resources and tailor recruitment or communication campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "The broad question we are focusing on is: \n",
    "> What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to answer the following question:\n",
    "> Can the age of the player predict if the player subscribes to a game-related newsletter in players.csv?\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores the relationship between player activity and continued interest in the game community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "We will be using the players data set from a UBC Computer Science Minecraft research server, which aims to record player activity and session behaviour for the purpose of studying engagement patterns. Two datasets were provided. Players.csv describes whether they chose to subscribe to a game-related newsletter, and sessions.csv describes how individual players interact with the game environment.\n",

    "To address my question I would use knn to predict classification. This would work because I am trying to guess which category players fall into, whether they subscribe or not, based on their age. Seeing that subscription is a categorical variable, classification is what is being predicted. The limitations are that this would only look at one variable, ignoring the fact that other variables may also influence the prediction. This also requires the assumption that age can predict whether or not players will subscribe which may be difficult because the graph seems to show a weak relationship between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do knn, the data should be split after wrangling but prior to making the model. 75% of the data should go into the training set and the rest into the testing set, ensuring shuffling and stratification happened. After splitting, the training set should be used to build the model. Cross-validation and tuning should also be done to find the best number of neighbours to provide the most accurate predictions that can be achieved. This will also help prevent underfitting or overfitting the model. The data will then be further split and a validation set created. After tuning the optimal k will be inserted and the prediciton will be run.\n",
