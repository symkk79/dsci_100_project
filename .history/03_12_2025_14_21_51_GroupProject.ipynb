    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In the past decade, we have seen a sharp rise in online gaming communities, which made understanding player engagement an essential part of managing servers and designing outreach strategies. Knowing which kinds of players are more likely to stay involved can help developers plan resources and tailor recruitment and communication campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broad question we are focusing on is: \n",
    "> What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to answer the following question:\n",
    "> Can the age of the player predict if the player subscribes to a game-related newsletter in players.csv?\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores the relationship between player activity and continued interestrecordse game community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The data set we use is from a UBC Computer Science Minecraft research server, which record player activity for the purpose of studying engagement patterns. Dataset of Players.csv describes the characteristics of each player and whether they chose to subscribe to a game-related newsletter.\n",

    "We then conducted exploratory data visualization to examine potential relationships between player characteristics and their subscription status. This included plotting:\n",
